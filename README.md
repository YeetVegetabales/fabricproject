2021 Science Fair Project - Predicting Percent Decrease

This project was conducted by washing shirts with various makeups of cotton and polyester and denoting the percent decrease in size.
I wrote a program to analyze this data and predict future percent decreases in dimensions depending on the amonut of cotton in the shirt.
While this data may not be completely accurate, it is a rough estimate that should remain consistent if the experiment were to be conducted further.
